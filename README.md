# multiserver-bluetooth-rp
A multiserver plugin that facilitates communication across bluetooth serial.

This module requires a bluetooth-repeater as a parameter for taking care of connections, disconnections and opening connection streams. This is to allow this plugin to be used on different platforms (e.g. mobile, linux, windows) with the same interface.
